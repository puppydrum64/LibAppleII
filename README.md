# LibAppleII
Contains code for my Apple II project.

This code is for the Apple II which used the 65C02 processor. There is NO attempt made for backwards compatibility with the NMOS 6502, since not having a dedicated PHX or PHY instruction makes programming much more difficult. Nor is there any assumption that the ability to use self-modifying code is limited in any way (I don't believe Apple II had any ROM cartridges anyway so this shouldn't be an issue)
